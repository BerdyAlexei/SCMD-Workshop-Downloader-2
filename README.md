## FAQ

- #### How to use it?
*SCMD Workshop Downloader 2* will tell you how to use it if you click on the options button and enter the *INFORMATION & HELP* tab.

- #### How does it works?
*SCMD Workshop Downloader 2* is a user interface to interact with *SCMD List Manager* that ultimately will analyze the links you enter in order to recognize if they are items or collections and collect all the information you need from them in order to generate a functional script for your use in *SteamCMD* to download the files corresponding to the links entered initially.

- #### Can you make this any game work with this method?
Since the only role of the application in regards to downloading the item you want is to get the information needed to use a script to download it with *SteamCMD*, no.

Whether a game allows downloads of its *Workshop* items without purchasing the game is entirely up to the creators of the game. If you want to know which games allow this operation you can enter the following link: https://steamdb.info/sub/17906/apps/

Likewise, *SCMD Workshop Downloader 2* will notify you if the link you entered belongs to a game on the list.

- #### Is this legal?
*SCMD Workshop Downloader 2* is only a means to use *SteamCMD*; an official tool that you can find at:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD

So yes, you will not be banned for using it with your account.

- #### Is this a virus?
No, but *it can be detected as one in the form of a false positive*: It's a bit my fault, I've had problems with *PyInstaller* (The tool with which you convert *Python* code into an executable) and when I create a program that happens, but I'm not the only one, here is some information that may help you understand:

As long as you're using *Windows 10 of 64-bit*, yes.
It might work on other *Windows* operating systems (and hopefully *Linux*) but I haven't tested it.

If you have tried it on any other operating system and it worked or not, please let me know.
